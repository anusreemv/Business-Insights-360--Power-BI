# Business-Insights-360--Power-BI

## 🚀 Transforming Data Chaos into Actionable Insights – Power BI to the Rescue! 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This project was built as part of the **Codebasics Data Analytics 4.0 Bootcamp**, where I designed and developed an end-to-end **Power BI dashboard** to solve real-world data challenges faced by **AtliQ Hardware**, a global electronics company.

With outdated Excel reports hampering strategic decision-making and forecast accuracy, AtliQ needed a better way to consume and act on business data. This dashboard empowers cross-functional teams by delivering **real-time, automated insights**.

## 🏢 About AtliQ Hardware

AtliQ Hardware specializes in selling computers and accessories globally. In an effort to expand into Latin American markets, they relied on intuition and surveys—which unfortunately led to **financial losses and missed targets**.

To correct course, AtliQ aimed to **embrace analytics** for informed, data-backed decisions.
